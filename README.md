# Universal 2nd Factor Microservice

#### Project Summary
	The purpose of the project is to aid in the pursuit of healthcare price transparency by providing a containerized database service populated with original data published by CMS, along with derived analytic data that 
	



	If other payers would

with information on services and procedures provided to Medicare beneficiaries by physicians and other healthcare professionals.

The Physician and Other Supplier PUF contains information on utilization, payment (allowed amount and Medicare payment), and submitted charges organized by National Provider Identifier (NPI), Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code, and place of service.


The goal here is for a first down -- not a touchdown.

This project  hopes 

 investigate these differences.

Problems

This dataset is limited to services billed to CMS and does not include all payers.

Charge Submitted vs Payment Accepted.
The magic behind this Î”

Providers are assigned Unique identifiers (NPIs)
Services listed rely on HCPCS Codes

The Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS, often pronounced by its acronym as "hick picks") is a set of health care procedure codes based on the American Medical Association's Current Procedural Terminology (CPT).

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get the project up and running.

## Deployment

To run **production image**:

```
make start
```

This process starts the database (with persistent data), cache server and the api microservice (and none of the development dependencies)

* Database | no port exposed
* Cache Server | no port exposed
* [API Microservice](http://0.0.0.0:8443) | port 8443

##### NOTE: In **Production**, you'll want to make sure you're managing the db service correctly (backups, dumps, snapshots, redundancy, etc). 

To build and tag a **production image** (`u2f-server:latest`) with your local changes use:

```
make release
```

**NOTE:** Production images hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/sudowing/u2f-server/)

## Schema

Data migrations for the app are managed via `knex migrate:latest` which is run in the container at runtime.

Below is a diagram of the schema for your reference.

![cms-schema source-data-tables](assets/img/readme/cms_schema_source_data.png "CMS Schema | Tables based on .CSV Source Data")

`u2f_key`, `otp_device`, and `backup_code` all hold records for configured MFA methods. The nickname field is only provided so the users can differentiate between their multiple devices (if they have them), as they're able to remove devices.

A `backup_code` is single use and is deleted upon successful authentication.

`auth_log` records all attempts to authenticate -- successful or failure. This could be useful in the future for rate-throttling or flagging activity.

## Development

Development doesn't require local installion of node or any of the project's dependencies. Instead, those dependencies are bundled within the docker container and [`nodemon`](https://nodemon.io/) monitors changes to the app's source (which is mounted from your local system to the docker container) and reload the microservice.

This command starts the app, it's dependencies (database & cache), and additional development services (https proxy & more).
```
make run
```
